# Simple Services Agreement

`Purpose` If you provide services to people as a contractor (software development, graphic design - stuff like that), the _Simple Services Agreement_:
- gets you paid;
- limits what you can get sued for; and
- makes clear what you agree to do for the customer.

This agreement is on [Github in Markdown](https://github.com/CodePact/au-simple-services/blob/master/au-simple-services.md).
