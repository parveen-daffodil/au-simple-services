# Simple Services Agreement

`Purpose` If you provide services to people (software development, lawn mowing, graphic design - stuff like that), the _Simple_ _Services_ _Agreement_:
- gets you paid;
- limits what you can get sued for; and
- describes what you agree to do for the customer.

Feel free to get in touch with Pat (the software provider / lawyer responsible for all this) on pat[at]codepact[dot]com to tell him what you think of CodePact.

## Duration of the agreement

This topic makes the start time and the end time of the agreement clear. Does the agreement:

- for as long as the job lasts?

Select an option…

### Provider will provide the Service to the Customer for an agreed period of time.

Provider will provide the Services to Customer for {{term duration}} after the parties enter the Agreement, unless the Agreement is terminated under another provision of the Agreement.

### Provider will provide the Service until it completes a certain agreed project.

## Calculation of fees

This topic describes the amount that the customer will pay the provider for the services.

Customer will pay the Provider the fees set out in the table below.

{{fees table}}

## Timing for payment of the fees

This topic clarifies _when_ the provider is paid.

Option 1 is best for services provided at an hourly (or some other) rate. Options 2 and 3 are best for work that is defined by the completion of a project agreed between the parties.

For larger projects, option 3 is likely the best method – smaller amounts of money change hands, and if the agreement isn’t working, the parties can agree to end it with less money being at stake.

### Provider will invoice Customer for the Services while the Services continue.

Provider will invoice Customer for the Services rendered during the previous {{billing cycle period}}. The Customer will pay the invoice within {{payment period}} of receiving the invoice.

### Customer will pay a deposit when the Services commence and the rest when the Services are complete.

Provider will issue Customer with an invoice:
- for a non-refundable deposit of {{deposit amount}} before commencing the Services; and
- for {{completion amount}} upon the completion of the Services,

both invoices to be paid by Customer within {{payment terms}} of Customer receiving the invoice.

### The parties will break up payments into "milestones" where Customer pays Provider when stages of the project are complete.

Provider will issue Customer with invoices for the amounts set out below in accordance with the completion milestones set out below.

{{milestones}}

Invoices from Provider will be paid by Customer within {{payment terms}} of Customer receiving the invoice.

## Limitation of liability

This topic sets out what the service provider will **compensate** the customer for if something goes wrong with the services.

It makes clear what limits there are on what the service provider can be sued for. That’s why it’s called the **"limitation of liability"**.

For example, if the service provider builds an app for a customer that doesn’t work, how much can the customer sue the service provider for?

This is a crucial part of the contract to get right – be careful!

### Provider will limit the amount it can be sued for by the Customer to the smallest possible amount.

Provider [limits liability as much as the law allows](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-limitation/blob/90bb197e3299a4025af8c3db50e33b3f291e66a2/au-limitation-0.md) to Customer for the Services, including liabilities caused by:

{{risks to exclude}}

### Provider will limit the amount it can be sued for by the Customer to the Liability Limit.

Provider limits liability to Customer for the Services to the cost of the Services in accordance with the [LawPatch amount limitation](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-limitation/blob/90bb197e3299a4025af8c3db50e33b3f291e66a2/au-limitation-1.md), including liabilities caused by:

{{risks to exclude}}

### Customer cannot sue Provider for direct liabilities but not indirect liabilities.

Provider [covers liabilities (except for consequential loss)](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-limitation/blob/90bb197e3299a4025af8c3db50e33b3f291e66a2/au-limitation-2.md) to Customer for the Services, including liabilities caused by:

{{risks to exclude}}

### Customer can sue Provider for any liability from the Services.

Provider [covers all liabilities incurred](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-limitation/blob/90bb197e3299a4025af8c3db50e33b3f291e66a2/au-limitation-3.md) by Customer for the Services.

## Termination

The parties need to figure out when the contract ends.

### If a party breaks the contract, the other party can terminate the contract.

Either party may terminate the Agreement if:
- a party notifies the other party of an Agreement breach; and
- 10 days after the breach notification, the Agreement breach is not remedied.

### Either party can end the agreement whenever they like.

Either party may terminate the Agreement {{termination process}}.

## Variables

#### term duration

NUMBER days [OR] NUMBER weeks [OR] NUMBER months

`Guidance` Fill in the period of time that the agreement will govern the provider and the client. The provider will provide the services for this period of time, and the customer will need to pay for the services for this period of time.

#### rate of payment

$ NUMBER per hour [OR] $ NUMBER per day [OR] the rate set out in the PROJECT SCOPE DOCUMENT

`Guidance` This variable can be filled in with: (1) the hourly rate of the provider; (2) the daily rate of the provider; or (3) the rate set out in a project scope document.

#### total amount

$AMOUNT [OR] the amount set out in the PROJECT SCOPE DOCUMENT

`Guidance` Fill in this variable with the total amount that the customer will pay the service provider for the services. It should be an all-inclusive amount because this is the _total_ amount. It’s probably a good idea to set out the amount of GST too.

#### document name

in the document entitled TITLE sent by email on DATE [OR] in the document at URL

`Guidance` Fill in this variable with the name of the document that describes the fees of the services provider. The document could be a "Project Scope Document", or a web page that sets out prices.

#### fees table

| Service | Amount
|----------------------|--------
| DESCRIBE SERVICE | $ AMOUNT
| DESCRIBE SERVICE | $ AMOUNT

`Guidance` Fill in the [markdown table](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) with the cost components of the services. In the left column, describe the service, and in the right column, describe the price as a dollar value.

#### code license purpose

any purpose whatsoever

`Guidance` This variable sets out the boundaries for the use of the code. The default value here of "any purpose whatsoever" is very expansive: it allows the recipient of the license to use the code in whatever way they want to, which the ownership remains with the license giver.

#### billing cycle period

month

`Guidance` Fill in this variable with a time period for the billing cycle. It’s great to get paid weekly, but you have to issue an invoice before you get paid. The billing cycle period is a balance between keeping your cash flow regular and the administrative overhead of issuing the invoices required to get paid.

#### payment period

14 days

`Guidance` Fill this variable in with the amount of time between the customer receiving the invoice and the invoice's due date for payment.

#### deposit amount

50% of the total amount payable for the Services [OR] $ DOLLAR_AMOUNT

`Guidance` The deposit is a non-refundable upfront payment for the services. It is usually defined as a percentage amount of the overall cost of the development services under the agreement. You could also use an amount, though.

#### completion amount

50% of the total amount payable for the Services

`Guidance` The completion amount is the money paid after the completion of the services. It is usually defined as a percentage amount of the overall cost of the development services under the agreement.

#### termination process

with 10 days of written notice to the other party

`Guidance` This is how a party can terminate the agreement. The default text sets out a system where you need to warn the other party with a written notification ten days before you terminate the agreement.

#### payment terms

14 days

`Guidance` This is the amount of time between the customer receiving the invoice and the invoice's due date for payment.

#### milestones

| Milestone | Payment
|----------------------|--------
| DESCRIBE MILESTONE | PAYMENT

`Guidance` This table variable is where you define the milestones for payment. The "Milestone" column is where the parties describe the services milestone that triggers the ability of the service provider to invoice for the amount in the "Payment" column. It's important to provide as much detail as possible about each milestone. An example might be, "Completion of the wireframe diagrams for the home page, profile page and news feed page."

#### risks to exclude

[PEOPLE AND PROPERTY]

- any death or injury;
- any property damage;

[DIGITAL INDUSTRIES]

- failure of any software, hardware or network components provided by a third party;
- software or hardware that's inaccessible for any reason;
- faulty or lost data associated with the Services;
- digital security issues like software vulnerabilities and malware;
- software in a testing phase like (or analogous to) beta and alpha software;

[CONSULTING]

- reliance on advice communicated by the Provider in whatever form;
- failure to provide correct information or opinions;
- faulty technical advice or data;

[CONSTRUCTION]

- failure of any third party equipment or materials;
- loss connected with access or access problems to the site of work;
- failure to use safety procedures or methods;
- loss during the process of delivery;
- the use, or breakdown of equipment used for the services;

[AGREEMENT RISKS]

- any act or omission connected with the Agreement;
- breaches of the Agreement;
- the termination of the Agreement; or
- any delay in the provision of the Services;

`Guidance` It’s very important to set out the risks that are most likely to cause problems (and get the service provider sued). Don’t rely on the lists in the default text – think of the biggest risks around the services you provide!

#### special conditions

TYPE SPECIAL CONDITIONS HERE

#### governing law state

New South Wales

`Guidance` This is the state that you will go to court in if there’s legal action under this document. It’s usually better to have a "home court" advantage. If your business is in New South Wales, make the forum the New South Wales courts.

#### limitation amount

the amount paid to the Provider by the Customer in exchange for the Services [OR] $AMOUNT

`Guidance` Describe the amount of money that the customer can sue the provider for. The example text allows the customer to get a full refund, since the Provider can sue for the amount paid for the services by the customer. You can describe the amount or put a specific dollar figure on it.

#### description of services

the TYPE OF SERVICES provided by Provider to Customer [OR] the document provided by Provider to Customer entitled "Scope of Work"

`Guidance` Fill this in with a description of the services provided by the service provider to the customer. There's a balance to be struck here. The description needs to capture all the work done by the provider for the customer, but it can't be so general that it is vague. You could refer to a "Scope of Work" document.
